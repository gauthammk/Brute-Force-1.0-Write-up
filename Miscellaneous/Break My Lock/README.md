# Break My Lock

Points : 25

## Solution

We are given an encrypted zip file. The password can be bruteforced with `rockyou.txt` and the script in `get_flag.py`. The obtained password is 'everlasting'. Opening the file with this password gives us the flag.

Flag : `HE{7his_Chall3nG3_!s_$0_Eassssy}`
